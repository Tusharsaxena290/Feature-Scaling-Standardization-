# Feature-Scaling-Standardization-
Here, we have performed Feature Scaling and then performed Feature Selection

# Feature Scaling(Standardization):-
The process of transforming data into a standard scale.

Standard Value= (Original value - Mean of variable)/ Standard Deviation of original value.

Standardization helps in solving the problem of dfferent feautures being of diffferent magnitude.

Machine Learning libraray SK-LEARN helps us to perform Standardization by importing the same.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
